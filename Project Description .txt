You know that you're in the right database when you see the name of the database at the beginning of the terminal line.
If you already know the name of the database you want to connect to, you can write psql name_of_database and that would be equivalent to psql postgres \c name_of_database
Remember to steer clear of double quotes around strings in your queries!
